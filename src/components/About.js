                    <h2 className='about-subtitle'>Can I use my driveway if it's not booked?</h2>
                    <p className='about-paragraph'>
                        If you know that you will need your driveway on a certain date
                        you should let us know at least a month in advance so we don't accept any 
                        bookings during this time. If this notice period is not met we may still be able
                        to oblige some requests at our discretion. Note that if you use your driveway during
                        a rental period we will request some componsation - this will usually be deducted
                        from next months rental fee. Please get in touch for more details.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className='about-subtitle'>What happens if there is damage to my driveway while it's being rented?</h2>
                    <p className='about-paragraph'>
                        This is a complicated question the answer to which will differ greatly dependent on the circumstances.
                        All we can guarantee at Park Pal is that we will be in frequent communication with you until the
                        situation is resolved.

                    <h2 className='about-subtitle'>What happens if a renter cancels their reservation?</h2>
                    <p className='about-paragraph'>
                        Nothing! One benefit of our using Park Pal is that we take any extended vacancy risks away from 
                        you the owner.
                    </p>
                    <h2 className='about-subtitle'>Can I choose who rents my driveway, or is it assigned randomly?</h2>
                    <p className='about-paragraph'>
                        Unfortunately if you rent your space to us, we will have full discretion over who can park there. If
                        you wish to rent your space out to someone else you will have to cancel your agreement with us (with
                        the proper notice) before doing so.

                    <p className='about-paragraph'>
                        We use a variety of factors to decide how much to offer space owners including but not limited to:
                        proximity to transport links, proximity to amenities, parking availability, and 
                    </p>
